    "Research has shown that smoking reduces life expectancy by seven to eight years. On average, 
    each cigarette shortens your life anywhere from seven to eleven minutes. In other words, the 
    time it takes you to smoke a cigarette equals the time that cigarette takes off of your life."

    "One of the first to scientifically document a link between physical activity and a longer, 
    healthier life was Ralph Paffenbarger Jr., a pioneering epidemiologist who taught at HSPH 
    from the 1960s to the 1990s. His attention-getting formula: Every hour of vigorous physical 
    activity earns the exerciser an extra two or three hours of life."
